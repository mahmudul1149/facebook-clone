# Facebook Clone
This project is a Facebook clone built using HTML, CSS, SASS, Vue.js, and Nuxt.js. It features Google Authentication for secure login/logout functionality, and the back-end is powered by Google Firebase, providing a scalable and secure cloud-based infrastructure. The application is highly responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes, thanks to the use of vw unit and media query.
